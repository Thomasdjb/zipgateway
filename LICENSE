# Licensing terms

Source code in this package is covered by one of several different licenses.
The default license is the Master Software License Agreement (MSLA) 
(https://www.silabs.com/about-us/legal/master-software-license-agreement),
which applies unless otherwise noted.

Some files use different licensing terms. If so, they will be clearly
marked in the beginning of the file.
